# Introduction :
As domestic air travel is getting more and more popular these days in India with various air ticket booking channels coming up online, travellers are trying to 
understand how these airline companies make decisions regarding ticket prices over time. Nowadays, airline corporations are using complex strategies and methods 
to assign airfare prices in a dynamic fashion. These strategies are taking into consideration several financial, marketing, commercial and social factors are 
closely connected with the ultimate airfare prices. Due to the high complexity of the pricing models applied by the airlines, it is very difficult for a customer
to purchase an air ticket at the lowest price, since the price changes dynamically.
  For this reason several technique ready to provide the proper time to the customer to buy an air ticket by predicting the airfare price, are proposed recently.
So machine learning is best for this technology

# About the data:
I have download the data from the kaggle
